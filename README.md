I consider myself a person who loves technology and innovation, that is always willing to learn new things and looking for a better and faster way to do tasks. And that's where my interests in BIM and programming match perfectly! For all those reasons, I decided to attend a 6 months' Full Stack Developer course to further develop my coding skills.
In the past years, I have been working in companies where I could develop applications that help that promote the digital transition for the construction industry.

Currently, I am working at [Leviat](https://leviat.com) where I am responsible for the coordination of the development of the company's product digital tools.
