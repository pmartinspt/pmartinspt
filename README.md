I consider myself a person who loves technology and innovation, that is always willing to learn new things and looking for a better and faster way to do tasks. And that's where my interests in BIM and programming match perfectly! For all those reasons, I decided to attend a 6 months' Full Stack Developer course to develop my coding skills

Currently, I am working at [BUILT CoLAB](https://builtcolab.pt) where I develop applications that will help promoting the Digital Transition for the Construction Industry.
